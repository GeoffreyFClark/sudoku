	create a sudoku board - initialize class variables and set up the 2D board
	This should initialize:
	self.row_length		- the length of each row
	self.removed_cells	- the total number of cells to be removed
	self.board			- a 2D list of ints to represent the board
	self.box_length		- the square root of row_length

	Parameters:
    row_length is the number of rows/columns of the board (always 9 for this project)
    removed_cells is an integer value - the number of cells to be removed

	None

DO NOT CHANGE
Provided for students
Given a number of rows and number of cells to remove, this function:
1. creates a SudokuGenerator
2. fills its values and saves this as the solved state
3. removes the appropriate number of cells
4. returns the representative 2D Python Lists of the board and solution

Parameters:
size is the number of rows/columns of the board (9 for this project)
removed is the number of cells to clear (set to 0)

Return: list[list] (a 2D Python list to represent the board)
