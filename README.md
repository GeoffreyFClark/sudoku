## Fork Repository Instructions
### Steps:
1. When you go to the github repository we provided, on the top right hand corner of the screen, there is a button that says "Fork". That will fork the repo to your own github and allow you to work on the project by adding your own files to the repository

## REPLIT Instructions

### Steps:
1. Go to [https://replit.com/~](https://replit.com/~) and create a free account
2. In the top left corner of the home page, select the dropdown and click the 'Create' button
3. In the Create window, click "Import from GitHub" in the top right corner of the box
4. Copy and paste your github url from the base of your repository into the box, and click "Import from GitHub"
5. You should be able to run your pygame project in Replit as long as the main file is called "sudoku.py". If it is named something different, either rename it to 'sudoku.py' or change the run command in the 'main.sh' file to run your filename instead
6. Happy Coding:)

## Joined Programming Instructions

### Steps:
1. When working on a replit project, there is a button on the top right side of the page called "Invite"
2. When you click that button, you can click "generate a join link" and give that to your groupmates to code on the same screen together
3. You can also invite them by email, but the join link is easier
